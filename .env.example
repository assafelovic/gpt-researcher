# Scraper Configuration
# ---------------------
# Control concurrent scraping and rate limiting to respect API limits

# Maximum concurrent scraper workers (simultaneous operations)
# Adjust based on your scraper service limits:
#   - Firecrawl Free: 2 concurrent browsers
#   - Firecrawl Hobby: 5 concurrent browsers
#   - BeautifulSoup/other scrapers: Set based on target site limits
# Default: 15 (may be too high for rate-limited APIs)
#MAX_SCRAPER_WORKERS=15

# Rate limiting: minimum seconds between scraper requests
# Controls request frequency to avoid exceeding API rate limits
# Calculate as: 60 / requests_per_minute
# Examples:
#   - Firecrawl Free (10 req/min): 6.0 seconds
#   - Firecrawl /scrape (10 req/min): 6.0 seconds
#   - Custom API (30 req/min): 2.0 seconds
#   - No rate limit: 0 (default)
# Note: Works with all scrapers (firecrawl, bs, browser, etc.)
# Default: 0.0 (no rate limiting)
#SCRAPER_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY=0.0
