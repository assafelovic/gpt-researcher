def curate_sources(query, sources, max_results=10):
    return f"""Your goal is to evaluate and curate the provided list of sources for the research task: "{query}".
The research task is focused on academic and valid medical literature. You must prioritize sources that align with this focus.

Each source in the list is a JSON object that may contain fields such as:
- `title`: Original title from the retriever.
- `scraped_title`: Title found during web scraping.
- `href`: URL of the source.
- `body`: Original abstract or summary from the retriever.
- `raw_content`: Full text content scraped from the web page.
- `retriever_name`: Identifier for the search service that found this source (e.g., "semantic_scholar", "pubmed_central", "arxiv", "google").
- `citation_count`: Number of citations (primarily from "semantic_scholar").
- `venue`: Publication venue (e.g., journal name from "semantic_scholar").
- `year`: Publication year.
- `journal_title`: Journal title (primarily from "pubmed_central").

EVALUATION AND CURATION GUIDELINES FOR ACADEMIC/MEDICAL RESEARCH:

1.  **Prioritize by Retriever Source:**
    *   Strongly prefer sources where `retriever_name` is "semantic_scholar", "pubmed_central", or "arxiv". These are primary academic/medical databases.
    *   Treat sources from general web retrievers (e.g., "google", "bing", "duckduckgo") with caution. Only include them if their content is exceptionally relevant, clearly academic or medical in nature (e.g., a direct link to a university research paper or a well-known medical institution's publication), and supports the primary academic sources.

2.  **Assess Academic Validity and Quality:**
    *   **For "semantic_scholar" sources:** Give very high priority to sources with a high `citation_count`. Also, consider the `venue` and `year`; more recent, highly cited articles in reputable venues are generally better.
    *   **For "pubmed_central" sources:** These are generally strong. Consider the `journal_title` for potential journal quality if available.
    *   **For "arxiv" sources:** These are pre-prints. They can be valuable for cutting-edge research but may not be peer-reviewed. Include if highly relevant.
    *   Evaluate the `raw_content` (or `body` if `raw_content` is minimal) for scientific rigor, appropriate methodology (if applicable), and clarity.
    *   Filter out sources that are clearly non-academic (e.g., news articles unless reporting on research, blog posts, forum discussions, commercial product pages) unless they provide specific, verifiable data or context directly supporting an academic point.

3.  **Relevance to Query:**
    *   The source must be highly relevant to the research task: "{query}".

4.  **Content Richness & Uniqueness:**
    *   Prefer sources with substantial `raw_content` that provides in-depth information.
    *   Among relevant and high-quality sources, aim for a diversity of information and perspectives.

5.  **Source Selection and Filtering:**
    *   Include up to {max_results} of the best sources based on the above criteria.
    *   Be prepared to filter aggressively if many sources are from general web retrievers or are of low academic quality. The goal is a curated list of high-quality academic/medical literature.
    *   If a source has both `body` (abstract) and `raw_content` (full text), your evaluation should primarily be based on the `raw_content` as it's more comprehensive.

6.  **Content Retention (Important for Output Format):**
    *   DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or condense any part of the source objects.
    *   Your task is to SELECT and REORDER the sources from the provided list.

SOURCES LIST TO EVALUATE:
{sources}

You MUST return your response as a JSON list of source objects, in the EXACT SAME FORMAT as they were provided in the input sources list.
The returned list should only contain the sources you've selected and prioritized, up to {max_results}.
The response MUST not contain any markdown format or additional text (like ```json), just the JSON list itself!

Content Focus:
- The report should focus on answering the question, be well-structured, informative, in-depth, and include facts and numbers if available.
- Use markdown syntax and follow the {report_format.upper()} format.
- When presenting data, comparisons, or structured information, use markdown tables to enhance readability.

IMPORTANT:Content and Sections Uniqueness:
- This part of the instructions is crucial to ensure the content is unique and does not overlap with existing reports.
- Carefully review the existing headers and existing written contents provided below before writing any new subsections.
- Prevent any content that is already covered in the existing written contents.
- Do not use any of the existing headers as the new subsection headers.
- Do not repeat any information already covered in the existing written contents or closely related variations to avoid duplicates.
- If you have nested subsections, ensure they are unique and not covered in the existing written contents.
- Ensure that your content is entirely new and does not overlap with any information already covered in the previous subtopic reports.

- Existing written contents from previous subtopic reports:

"Structure and Formatting":

- You MUST include markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

    ### Section Header
    
    This is a sample text ([in-text citation](url)).

- Use H2 for the main subtopic header (##) and H3 for subsections (###).
- Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.
- Organize your content into distinct sections that complement but do not overlap with existing reports.
- When adding similar or identical subsections to your report, you should clearly indicate the differences between and the new content and the existing written content from previous subtopic reports. For example:

    ### New header (similar to existing header)

    While the previous section discussed [topic A], this section will explore [topic B]."
