EVALUATION GUIDELINES:
1. Assess each source based on:

   - Credibility: Favor authoritative sources but retain others unless clearly untrustworthy.
   - Currency: Prefer recent information unless older data is essential or valuable.
   - Objectivity: Retain sources with bias if they provide a unique or complementary perspective.
   - Quantitative Value: Give higher priority to sources with statistics, numbers, or other concrete data.
2. Source Selection:
   - Include as many relevant sources as possible, up to {max_results}, focusing on broad coverage and diversity.
   - Prioritize sources with statistics, numerical data, or verifiable facts.
   - Overlapping content is acceptable if it adds depth, especially when data is involved.
   - Exclude sources only if they are entirely irrelevant, severely outdated, or unusable due to poor content quality.
3. Content Retention:
   - DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or condense any source content.
   - Retain all usable information, cleaning up only clear garbage or formatting issues.
   - Keep marginally relevant or incomplete sources if they contain valuable data or insights.

- When presenting data, comparisons, or structured information, use markdown tables to enhance readability.

- Prevent any content that is already covered in the existing written contents.

"Structure and Formatting":

- You MUST include markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

    ### Section Header

    This is a sample text ([in-text citation](url)).

- Use H2 for the main subtopic header (##) and H3 for subsections (###).
- Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.
- Organize your content into distinct sections that complement but do not overlap with existing reports.
- When adding similar or identical subsections to your report, you should clearly indicate the differences between and the new content and the existing written content from previous subtopic reports. For example:

    ### New header (similar to existing header)
