- Including a wide range of perspectives and insights
- Filtering out only clearly irrelevant or unusable content

EVALUATION GUIDELINES:
1. Assess each source based on:

   - Credibility: Favor authoritative sources but retain others unless clearly untrustworthy.
   - Currency: Prefer recent information unless older data is essential or valuable.
   - Objectivity: Retain sources with bias if they provide a unique or complementary perspective.
   - Quantitative Value: Give higher priority to sources with statistics, numbers, or other concrete data.
2. Source Selection:
   - Include as many relevant sources as possible, up to {max_results}, focusing on broad coverage and diversity.
   - Prioritize sources with statistics, numerical data, or verifiable facts.
   - Overlapping content is acceptable if it adds depth, especially when data is involved.
   - Exclude sources only if they are entirely irrelevant, severely outdated, or unusable due to poor content quality.
3. Content Retention:
   - DO NOT rewrite, summarize, or condense any source content.
   - Retain all usable information, cleaning up only clear garbage or formatting issues.
   - Keep marginally relevant or incomplete sources if they contain valuable data or insights.

SOURCES LIST TO EVALUATE:

Content Focus:
- The report should focus on answering the question, be well-structured, informative, in-depth, and include facts and numbers if available.
- Use markdown syntax and follow the {report_format.upper()} format.
- When presenting data, comparisons, or structured information, use markdown tables to enhance readability.

IMPORTANT:Content and Sections Uniqueness:
- This part of the instructions is crucial to ensure the content is unique and does not overlap with existing reports.
- Carefully review the existing headers and existing written contents provided below before writing any new subsections.
- Prevent any content that is already covered in the existing written contents.
- Do not use any of the existing headers as the new subsection headers.
- Do not repeat any information already covered in the existing written contents or closely related variations to avoid duplicates.
- If you have nested subsections, ensure they are unique and not covered in the existing written contents.
- Ensure that your content is entirely new and does not overlap with any information already covered in the previous subtopic reports.

"Existing Subtopic Reports":
- Existing subtopic reports and their section headers:

    {existing_headers}

- Existing written contents from previous subtopic reports:

    {relevant_written_contents}

"Structure and Formatting":
- As this sub-report will be part of a larger report, include only the main body divided into suitable subtopics without any introduction or conclusion section.

- You MUST include markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

    ### Section Header
    
    This is a sample text ([in-text citation](url)).

- Use H2 for the main subtopic header (##) and H3 for subsections (###).
- Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.
- Organize your content into distinct sections that complement but do not overlap with existing reports.
- When adding similar or identical subsections to your report, you should clearly indicate the differences between and the new content and the existing written content from previous subtopic reports. For example:

    ### New header (similar to existing header)

    While the previous section discussed [topic A], this section will explore [topic B]."

"Date":
