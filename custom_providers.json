It introduces a hybrid reasoning approach, allowing users to choose between rapid responses and extended, step-by-step processing for complex tasks. The model demonstrates notable improvements in coding, particularly in front-end development and full-stack updates, and excels in agentic workflows, where it can autonomously navigate multi-step processes. \n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet maintains performance parity with its predecessor in standard mode while offering an extended reasoning mode for enhanced accuracy in math, coding, and instruction-following tasks.\n\nRead more at the [blog post here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet)"

Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:\n\n- Significantly more knowledge and has greatly improved capabilities in coding and mathematics, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.\n\n- Significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON. More resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.\n\n- Long-context Support up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.\n\n- Multilingual support for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more.\n\nUsage of this model is subject to [Tongyi Qianwen LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen1.5-110B-Chat/blob/main/LICENSE)."
