## [Mikumba II](https://cruising.liveaboardindonesia.com/mikumba-2)

## Kathleen McAdam

## 🇿🇦 South Africa

**Review:**

This liveaboard is truly exemplary. Mikumba Dua is a traditionally-styled vessel that is solid, well equipped, lovingly restored, and very well maintained. The crew is fantastic. The food is tasty, fresh and healthy, and like the diving, very varied. Every single dive was different in its character.

High five to local guides they have on board especially Dani the batman.

I wish the dive time could be earlier for the hammer hunting. And i wish the cruise directors work together with the local dive guides they have on boat to make banda sea trip the most memorable because banda sea trip should be an epic trip.

## James Avery

## 🇺🇸 United States

**Review:**

Crew was excellent. Diving wonderful but giving 8 just because it’s Indo and, while N Sulawesi is amazing, it’s nothing like Raja, Komodo, or even South Sulawesi. The food was really good but could have have greater variety. We are a lot of the same stuff. Absolutely loved the boat. Value I would give 15 out of 10. Excellent experience, amazing boat and incredible diving for a VERY good price.

**Recommended for:**

Anyone with advanced cert, 60+ dives, especially for those while amazing walls. Great for macro too.

## 🇿🇦 South Africa

**Review:**

This liveaboard is truly exemplary. Mikumba Dua is a traditionally-styled vessel that is solid, well equipped, lovingly restored, and very well maintained. The crew is fantastic. The food is tasty, fresh and healthy, and like the diving, very varied. Every single dive was different in its character.

**Review:**

The crew on emperor harmoni during my trip are simply awesome in every single thing.

High five to local guides they have on board especially Dani the batman.

I wish the dive time could be earlier for the hammer hunting. And i wish the cruise directors work together with the local dive guides they have on boat to make banda sea trip the most memorable because banda sea trip should be an epic trip.

## James Avery

## 🇺🇸 United States

**Review:**

Crew was excellent. Diving wonderful but giving 8 just because it’s Indo and, while N Sulawesi is amazing, it’s nothing like Raja, Komodo, or even South Sulawesi. The food was really good but could have have greater variety. We are a lot of the same stuff. Absolutely loved the boat. Value I would give 15 out of 10. Excellent experience, amazing boat and incredible diving for a VERY good price.

**Recommended for:**

Anyone with advanced cert, 60+ dives, especially for those while amazing walls. Great for macro too.
