## Reporting Issues

If you come across any issue or have an idea for an improvement, don't hesitate to create an issue on GitHub. Describe your problem in sufficient detail, providing as much relevant information as possible. This way, we can reproduce the issue before attempting to fix it or respond appropriately.

## Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.** 
If it's not an urgent bug fix, you should branch from `master` and work on the feature or fix in there.

2. **Conduct your changes.**
Make your changes following best practices for coding in the project's language. 

3. **Test your changes.**
Make sure your changes pass all the tests if there are any. If the project doesn't have automated testing infrastructure, test your changes manually to confirm they behave as expected.

4. **Follow the coding style.**
Ensure your code adheres to the coding conventions used throughout the project, that includes indentation, accurate comments, etc.

5. **Commit your changes.**
Make your git commits informative and concise. This is very helpful for others when they look at the git log.

6. **Push to your fork and submit a pull request.**
When your work is ready and passes tests, push your branch to your fork of the repository and submit a pull request from there.

7. **Pat your back and wait for the review.**
Your work is done, congratulations! Now sit tight. The project maintainers will review your submission as soon as possible. They might suggest changes or ask for improvements. Both constructive conversation and patience are key to the collaboration process.


## Documentation

If you would like to contribute to the project's documentation, please follow the same steps: fork the repository, make your changes, test them, and submit a pull request. 

Documentation is a vital part of any software. It's not just about having good code. Ensuring that the users and contributors understand what's going on, how to use the software or how to contribute, is crucial.

We're grateful for all our contributors, and we look forward to building the world's leading AI research agent hand-in-hand with you. Let's harness the power of Open Source and AI to change the world together!
