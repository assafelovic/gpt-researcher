## 5. Common Complaints in 5-Star Reviews

Despite overwhelmingly positive feedback, even 5-star reviews frequently mention areas for improvement. The three most common complaints are:

1. **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Guests often note intermittent or slow internet, especially when sailing away from Labuan Bajo harbor ([Zada Liveaboard](https://www.zadaliveaboard.com/)).
2. **Limited Onboard Entertainment**: While the natural scenery is the main draw, some guests wish for more diverse entertainment options during downtime ([Aliikai Voyage](https://aliikai-voyage.com/)).
3. **Last-Minute Itinerary Changes**: Weather or park regulations occasionally force route adjustments, which, though handled professionally, can disappoint guests with rigid expectations ([Komodo Luxury](https://www.komodoluxury.com/)).

---

## 6. Demand Trends in Labuan Bajo: Seasonality and Key Events

### Seasonality

- **Peak Season**: April–December (Dry Season)
  - Highest demand, especially June–September and during Indonesian school holidays.
  - Charter prices and occupancy rates spike, with advance bookings recommended ([Liveaboard.com](https://www.liveaboard.com/)).
- **Low Season**: January–March (Rainy Season)
  - Lower demand due to rougher seas and rain, but still attractive to budget travelers and divers seeking manta ray encounters.
  - Prices drop, and last-minute deals are more common.

- **Year-End Holidays (December–January)**: High demand for family and group charters.

## 10. SWOT Analysis: Us vs. The Trans Luxury Yacht

|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Strengths**    | - Diverse fleet (phinisi, catamaran, motor yacht)<br>- Strong eco-tourism focus<br>- Customizable itineraries<br>- Competitive pricing<br>- Deep local partnerships | - Brand recognition<br>- Large, ultra-premium vessel<br>- Consistent 5-star service |
| **Weaknesses**   | - Smaller marketing budget<br>- Less global brand awareness | - Less flexible for small groups<br>- Higher minimum spend<br>- Limited departure frequency |
| **Opportunities**| - Growing mid-luxury and eco-conscious segment<br>- Partnerships with boutique resorts<br>- Expansion into themed charters (wellness, culinary) | - Tap into ultra-high-net-worth market<br>- Leverage international travel agency networks |
