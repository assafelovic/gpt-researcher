# Main Challenges in Blockchain Implementation in the Logistics Sector: Insights from 2024 Developments

## Abstract

The logistics sector increasingly turns to blockchain technology to address persistent issues of transparency, efficiency, and trust. However, as of 2024, widespread adoption remains hampered by a range of technical, organizational, regulatory, and economic challenges. This report synthesizes findings from recent, high-quality research and case studies, integrating insights from foundational principles to advanced, sector-specific developments. It critically examines the main barriers to blockchain implementation in logistics, drawing on both global and Indonesian contexts, and provides a structured, evidence-based analysis.

---

## 1. Introduction

Blockchain’s promise in logistics lies in its ability to create tamper-proof, decentralized ledgers that enable real-time, end-to-end visibility across complex supply chains ([Polyestertime, 2025](https://www.polyestertime.com/); [PeerJ, 2024](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2466/)). Yet, despite pilot successes and regulatory advances, the sector faces significant obstacles in moving from proof-of-concept to full-scale, interoperable deployment. This report explores these challenges, focusing on the most recent and reliable findings.

---

## 2. Technical and Infrastructural Challenges

### 2.1. Integration with Legacy Systems

One of the foremost technical barriers is the integration of blockchain platforms with existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Warehouse Management Systems (WMS), and other logistics IT infrastructures. Pilot deployments reveal that such integration requires careful planning to mitigate technical complexity and high upfront costs ([JIC Nusantara, 2024](https://jicnusantara.com/index.php/jiic/article/view/593)). Legacy systems often lack the modularity or API support necessary for seamless data exchange, leading to duplication, errors, and increased operational risk.

### 2.2. Scalability and Performance

Blockchain networks, especially those using public or consortium models, can struggle with transaction throughput and latency. For logistics, where real-time data is crucial, delays in consensus or block finality can disrupt operations. For example, optimistic rollups offer high throughput but require a 7-day fraud-proof window, which is unsuitable for time-sensitive logistics, whereas ZK-rollups achieve faster finality but at higher computational costs ([StarkWare, 2024](https://starkware.co/blog/zk-rollups-explained/zk-rollups-vs-optimistic-rollups/); [Pintu, 2024](https://pintu.co.id/academy/post/perbedaan-zk-rollup-dan-optimistic-rollup)).

### 2.3. Data Privacy and Confidentiality

Logistics often involves sensitive commercial data. While blockchain’s transparency is an asset for traceability, it can conflict with confidentiality requirements. Recent advances, such as zero-knowledge proofs and private/consortium blockchains, allow for selective disclosure, but their implementation adds complexity and can limit interoperability ([Polyestertime, 2025](https://www.polyestertime.com/)).

### 2.4. Monitoring, Security, and Node Management

Ensuring the security and integrity of blockchain nodes and smart contracts demands robust monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack). This requirement increases operational overhead and necessitates specialized skills ([LinkedIn, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-based-smart-contracts-logistics-operations-tayyab-javed-ndqlf)).

---

## 3. Organizational and Human Capital Barriers

### 3.1. Stakeholder Coordination and Change Management

Blockchain’s value in logistics is maximized when multiple stakeholders—manufacturers, shippers, customs, retailers—participate in a shared network. Achieving this coordination is challenging due to varying digital readiness, resistance to change, and concerns over data sharing ([Deloitte, 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/services/consulting/articles/blockchain-supply-chain-innovation.html); [JIC Nusantara, 2024](https://jicnusantara.com/index.php/jiic/article/view/593)). The need for cross-organizational governance models and advisory boards further complicates scaling beyond pilot phases ([Haslam UTK, 2024](https://haslam.utk.edu/gsci/news/blockchain-for-supply-chain-evaluating-the-roi-of-blockchain-technology/)).

### 3.2. Skills Gap

Blockchain implementation requires expertise in distributed systems, cryptography, smart contract development, and cybersecurity. The scarcity of such talent, especially in emerging markets, slows adoption and increases costs ([PeerJ, 2024](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2466/)).

---

## 4. Regulatory and Legal Challenges

### 4.1. Evolving Regulatory Landscape

The regulatory environment for blockchain in logistics is rapidly evolving. In Indonesia, the transfer of crypto-asset oversight from Bappebti to OJK in 2025, and the explicit legal recognition of blockchain under PP 28/2025, mark significant progress ([SSEK, 2025](https://ssek.com/blog/indonesia-blockchain-2025-regulatory-guide/); [RootData, 2025](https://www.rootdata.com/news/129389)). However, regulatory uncertainty remains, especially regarding cross-border data transfer, consumer protection, and compliance with sectoral standards ([Mondaq, 2025](https://www.mondaq.com/fin-tech/1649858/indonesia-blockchain-2025-regulatory-guide)).

#### Table 1: Key Regulatory Milestones in Indonesia (2023-2025)

| Year | Regulation/Authority | Key Impact                                 |
|------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 2023 | Law No. 4/2023      | OJK assumes crypto-asset oversight         |
| 2025 | PP 28/2025          | Blockchain, Web3, NFT legally recognized   |
| 2025 | OJK Reg 27/2024     | Stricter consumer/data protection, licensing|

([RootData, 2025](https://www.rootdata.com/news/129389); [SSEK, 2025](https://ssek.com/blog/indonesia-blockchain-2025-regulatory-guide/))

### 4.2. Cross-Border and Multi-Jurisdictional Issues

Logistics is inherently global, but blockchain networks often face fragmented legal frameworks across jurisdictions. Harmonizing standards, ensuring legal enforceability of smart contracts, and managing data sovereignty are unresolved issues ([LinkedIn, 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ronaldmtucker_the-%F0%9D%90%86%F0%9D%90%A5%F0%9D%90%A8%F0%9D%90%9B%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%A5-%F0%9D%90%83%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%A0%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%AD%F0%9D%90%9A%F0%9D%90%A5-%F0%9D%90%80%F0%9D%90%AC%F0%9D%90%AC%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AD-activity-7351121854796922881-XiK_)).

---

## 5. Economic and ROI Considerations

### 5.1. High Upfront and Ongoing Costs

Blockchain implementation in logistics involves significant initial investment in IT infrastructure, software development, integration, and training. Ongoing costs include platform upgrades, service fees, and compliance management ([Haslam UTK, 2024](https://haslam.utk.edu/gsci/news/blockchain-for-supply-chain-evaluating-the-roi-of-blockchain-technology/); [Zeeve, 2023](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/achieving-roi-with-blockchain-in-the-enterprise-a-cost-benefit-analysis/)). For SMEs, these costs can represent 30–50% of annual working capital, a major barrier to adoption ([IPQI, 2024](https://ipqi.org/transformasi-logistik-4-0-strategi-jitu-digitalisasi-supply-chain-management-untuk-dominasi-pasar-2025/)).

#### Table 2: Blockchain ROI Phases in Logistics

| Phase            | ROI Profile                 | Main Activities/Barriers                   |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Pilot Project    | Limited/No ROI              | Proof of concept, high integration costs   |
| Commercial Market| Gradual ROI                 | Scaling, governance, stakeholder onboarding|
| Network of Networks | High ROI (long-term)     | Ecosystem upgrades, interoperability       |

([Haslam UTK, 2024](https://haslam.utk.edu/gsci/news/blockchain-for-supply-chain-evaluating-the-roi-of-blockchain-technology/))

### 5.2. Unclear or Delayed Return on Investment

Most blockchain pilots in logistics serve as proofs of concept rather than profit centers. While long-term benefits—such as a 5% reduction in freight spend (equivalent to $100 million in oil & gas)—are documented, these gains typically materialize only after network effects and standardization are achieved ([Haslam UTK, 2024](https://haslam.utk.edu/gsci/news/blockchain-for-supply-chain-evaluating-the-roi-of-blockchain-technology/); [LinkedIn, 2024](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-supply-chain-mihir-kavishwar-6flde)).

---

## 6. Conceptual and Sector-Specific Barriers

### 6.1. Complexity of Process Mapping and Standardization

Logistics processes are highly variable and involve multiple actors with differing standards. Establishing shared data models, process flows, and smart contract templates is a non-trivial task ([Semanticscholar, 2023](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b95d/5bf8047d962beadbabcfa185686ef0ecfdde.pdf)). Without standardization, interoperability and scalability are limited.

### 6.2. Trust and Consortium Dynamics

Consortium blockchains, the preferred model for multi-stakeholder logistics, require trust among known validators and clear governance ([Blockchainmedia, 2024](https://blockchainmedia.id/perbedaan-blockchain-publik-privat-dan-konsorsium/)). Power imbalances, reluctance to share data, and unclear dispute resolution mechanisms can undermine network effectiveness.

---

## 7. Case Studies and Empirical Evidence

### 7.1. Indonesia: Port Management and Logistics Services

A 2023 pilot in Indonesian port management identified high process complexity, lack of transparency, and data integrity risks as primary barriers to blockchain adoption. The study emphasized the need for comprehensive frameworks and feasibility analyses before scaling ([Semanticscholar, 2023](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b95d/5bf8047d962beadbabcfa185686ef0ecfdde.pdf)). Similarly, research on logistics service providers in Indonesia highlighted three key characteristics for successful blockchain models: collaborative consortia, private blockchains with strong cryptography, and smart contract-driven efficiency ([UI Library, 2020](https://lib.ui.ac.id/detail?id=20505751&lokasi=lokal)).

### 7.2. Global: Supply Chain Transparency and Efficiency

Walmart’s blockchain pilot reduced the time to trace mangoes from days to seconds, demonstrating potential efficiency gains ([PeerJ, 2024](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-2466/)). However, such pilots often expose weaknesses in legacy IT and uneven stakeholder digital readiness ([Academia, 2024](https://www.academia.edu/114114652/Blockchain_conceptual_framework_in_shipping_and_port_management)).

---

## 8. Synthesis and Critical Perspective

The evidence indicates that while blockchain offers transformative potential for logistics—enhancing transparency, reducing fraud, and streamlining operations—its implementation faces multi-layered challenges. The most significant barriers are not technical alone, but organizational (stakeholder alignment, skills gap), regulatory (fragmented and evolving frameworks), and economic (high costs, delayed ROI). Success stories remain largely confined to pilots or limited-scale deployments, with full network effects yet to be realized.

A critical insight is that blockchain’s value in logistics is contingent on ecosystem-wide adoption, standardization, and regulatory clarity. Without these, the technology risks becoming another siloed solution rather than the interoperable backbone of future supply chains.

---

## 9. Conclusion

In conclusion, blockchain implementation in logistics as of 2024 is characterized by cautious optimism tempered by substantial challenges. The sector’s future hinges on addressing integration, scalability, governance, and regulatory barriers through collaborative, phased approaches. Policymakers and industry leaders must prioritize harmonization, capacity building, and incentives to unlock blockchain’s full potential in logistics.
