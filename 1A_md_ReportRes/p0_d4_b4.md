# Key Challenges in Blockchain Implementation for the Logistics Sector: Insights from 2024 Developments

## Executive Summary

Blockchain technology has been widely recognized as a transformative force in the logistics sector, promising enhanced transparency, security, efficiency, and traceability across supply chains. However, despite significant advancements and pilot projects in 2024, the implementation of blockchain in logistics continues to face substantial challenges. These challenges are multi-dimensional, spanning technical, regulatory, organizational, and market-related domains. This report synthesizes recent research, empirical case studies, and industry trends to provide a comprehensive analysis of the main barriers to blockchain adoption in logistics, drawing on the latest data and authoritative sources.

---

## 1. Introduction

Blockchain’s potential to revolutionize logistics is supported by its core attributes: decentralized data management, immutable records, and automated workflows via smart contracts. Yet, the journey from pilot to production has exposed a host of obstacles that impede large-scale, sustainable adoption. This report systematically examines these challenges, integrating findings from technical studies, regulatory analyses, and real-world case implementations.

---

## 2. Technical Challenges

### 2.1 Scalability and Performance

A persistent technical hurdle is the scalability of blockchain platforms. Logistics operations generate high transaction volumes and require real-time processing, which many current blockchain solutions struggle to handle efficiently. For instance, studies benchmarking permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric highlight significant performance degradation as network size and transaction load increase ([Abbasi et al., 2025](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-3698-0_1)). This is particularly problematic for global logistics networks, where throughput and latency are critical.

**Table 1: Performance Bottlenecks in Leading Blockchain Platforms**

| Platform            | Max TPS (Transactions per Second) | Latency (s) | Scalability Issues              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Hyperledger Fabric  | 2,000–3,000                       | 1–5         | Degrades with >50 peers         |
| Ethereum (public)   | 15–30                             | 10–60       | High fees, congestion           |
| Corda               | 100–500                           | 2–10        | Peer-to-peer bottlenecks        |

### 2.2 Interoperability

The logistics sector is characterized by a multitude of legacy systems and diverse blockchain platforms. Achieving seamless interoperability—data and asset transfer across different blockchains and with traditional IT systems—remains a major challenge. Despite the emergence of protocols like Cosmos IBC, Polkadot XCMP, and Axelar, only 25% of cross-chain bridges support liquid assets like stablecoins, and 80% of blockchain projects report integration complexity as a barrier ([CoinLaw, 2025](https://coinlaw.io/blockchain-interoperability-statistics/)). The lack of universal standards leads to fragmentation and increased integration costs.

### 2.3 Data Privacy and Security

While blockchain’s transparency is an asset, it can conflict with data privacy requirements, especially in cross-border logistics. Regulations such as the EU’s GDPR, which mandates the right to be forgotten, are at odds with blockchain’s immutability ([Dib et al., 2018](https://www.thinkmind.org/articles/tele_v11_n12_2018_5.pdf)). Additionally, 40% of interoperability platforms still rely on centralized validators or oracles, creating potential single points of failure ([CoinLaw, 2025](https://coinlaw.io/blockchain-interoperability-statistics/)).

---

## 3. Regulatory and Legal Challenges

### 3.1 Regulatory Uncertainty and Fragmentation

Regulatory uncertainty is cited by 70% of enterprises as a significant obstacle to blockchain adoption in logistics ([CoinLaw, 2025](https://coinlaw.io/blockchain-interoperability-statistics/)). Jurisdictions differ widely in their treatment of digital assets, smart contracts, and data residency. For example, China’s Blockchain Service Network (BSN) enforces strict government oversight, while Singapore fosters innovation with balanced regulatory frameworks ([Sangari et al., 2024](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/imds-03-2023-0197/full/html)). This regulatory patchwork complicates cross-border logistics operations, increasing compliance costs and legal risk.

### 3.2 Legal Recognition of Digital Documents and Smart Contracts

Although electronic bills of lading (eBL) and smart contracts are gaining traction, their legal enforceability is not universally recognized. The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) achieved a milestone with the first interoperable eBL transaction in 2025, but widespread adoption depends on harmonized legal frameworks ([DCSA, 2025](https://dcsa.org/newsroom/ebl-interoperability-milestone)). The lack of standardization in contract law and dispute resolution mechanisms remains a barrier ([Acharya & Kulshrestha, 2024](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-3690-4_55)).

### 3.3 Compliance and Auditing

Blockchain’s immutable records facilitate auditing, but integrating blockchain data with existing compliance systems is complex. Organizations must establish robust key management, separation of duties, and comprehensive auditing procedures to ensure accountability ([NIST, 2024](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt2/r1/final)).

---

## 4. Organizational and Market Challenges

### 4.1 Integration with Legacy Systems

Integrating blockchain solutions with entrenched legacy systems is both technically and organizationally challenging. Many logistics firms operate on outdated IT infrastructure, making integration costly and time-consuming ([PuskoMedia, 2024](https://puskomedia.id/blog/mengoptimalkan-manajemen-rantai-pasokan-dengan-blockchain-studi-kasus-dalam-sektor-logistik/)). The need for interoperability with existing ERPs, warehouse management, and customs systems often slows down blockchain deployment.

### 4.2 High Initial Implementation Costs

The upfront investment required to develop, deploy, and integrate blockchain solutions is significant. This includes costs for infrastructure, training, and process reengineering. SMEs, which constitute a large portion of the logistics sector, often lack the resources to absorb these costs ([Skripsi Malang, 2024](https://skripsimalang.com/jasa-skripsi-malang/studi-kasus-implementasi-teknologi-blockchain-dalam-industri-logistik-global/)).

### 4.3 Stakeholder Alignment and Trust

Blockchain’s value proposition relies on multi-party collaboration and data sharing. However, building trust among diverse logistics actors—suppliers, 2PL/3PLs, distributors, and retailers—remains a technical and cultural prerequisite ([CKB Logistics, 2024](https://www.ckb.co.id/industry-news/read/ini-tantangan-penerapan-blockchain-di-sektor-logistik)). Achieving a level playing field and platform uniformity is essential to ensure data transparency and validity.

### 4.4 Theory–Practice Disconnect

Academic research often proposes governance models and frameworks without clear operational pathways for real-world logistics environments. There is a pronounced gap between theoretical models and empirical validation, underscoring the need for more case studies and quantitative assessments ([Zhao et al., 2025](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44257-025-00032-7)).

---

## 5. Sector-Specific and Advanced Insights

### 5.1 Supply Chain Finance (SCF) and SME Inclusion

Blockchain-powered SCF platforms, such as IBM’s we.trade and China’s Linklogis, have demonstrated the ability to enhance visibility and credibility across multi-tier logistics networks, enabling deep-tier SMEs to access bank financing ([Emerald, 2023](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/jts-06-2023-0003/full/html)). However, information asymmetry, lack of collateral, and fragmented data sources still hinder widespread SME participation.

### 5.2 ESG and Sustainability Integration

The push for sustainable logistics and ESG compliance is driving blockchain adoption. The ASEAN Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide for SMEs and initiatives like Project Greenprint in Singapore exemplify efforts to standardize ESG reporting using blockchain ([ACMF, 2025](https://www.theacmf.org/media/news-release/acmf-releases-simplified-guidance-for-asean-smes-in-supply-chains-version-1); [Standard Chartered, 2025](https://www.sc.com/en/news/corporate-investment-banking/sustainable-trade-ecosystem-aseans/)). Yet, the lack of harmonized standards and reliable sustainability data remains an issue.

### 5.3 Real-World Case Studies

- **Maersk and IBM**: Their TradeLens platform demonstrated increased transparency and reduced paperwork but faced challenges in onboarding stakeholders and achieving network effects ([Skripsi Malang, 2024](https://skripsimalang.com/jasa-skripsi-malang/studi-kasus-implementasi-teknologi-blockchain-dalam-industri-logistik-global/)).
- **CEVA Logistics & Avolta**: Pilot projects integrating real-time transport data with blockchain have shown emission reductions and improved visibility, but scaling such pilots remains difficult ([Advanced Biofuels USA, 2024](https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/)).

## 7. Synthesis and Opinion

The 2024 landscape illustrates that while blockchain’s technical maturity and ecosystem support have advanced, the sector’s progress is hampered by persistent, interlinked challenges. The most critical barriers are not purely technical but lie at the intersection of regulation, organizational change, and ecosystem coordination. The lack of harmonized standards and regulatory clarity, combined with the high cost and complexity of integration, are the primary bottlenecks. 

However, the emergence of interoperable eBLs, programmable payments, and ESG-linked blockchain solutions signals that the sector is moving toward greater standardization and practical utility. The success of these initiatives will depend on continued collaboration between regulators, industry consortia, and technology providers to address interoperability, legal recognition, and governance gaps.

**Concrete Opinion:**  
Blockchain will not achieve mainstream adoption in logistics until the sector overcomes regulatory fragmentation, establishes robust interoperability standards, and lowers the cost and complexity of integration for SMEs. The most promising path forward is through industry-wide consortia, public-private partnerships, and regulatory sandboxes that allow for iterative, empirical validation of blockchain solutions in real-world logistics environments.

---

## 8. Recommendations

- **Prioritize Regulatory Harmonization:** Policymakers should work toward cross-border regulatory alignment, particularly for digital documents, data privacy, and smart contract enforceability.
- **Invest in Interoperability Standards:** Industry consortia must accelerate the development and adoption of open standards for data exchange and cross-chain communication.
- **Support SME Onboarding:** Targeted subsidies, training, and simplified integration tools are needed to lower barriers for SMEs.
- **Foster Empirical Research:** More pilot projects and quantitative studies are required to bridge the theory–practice gap and inform scalable governance models.
