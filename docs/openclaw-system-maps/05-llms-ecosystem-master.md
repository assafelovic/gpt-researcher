# HLT Ecosystem Index for Agents

> Official cross-repo front door for AI agents working anywhere in the HLT ecosystem. Read this file first. It explains what repos exist, what they are for, where they live, what URLs they own, what core shapes and contracts matter, which systems are canonical, and how to navigate the ecosystem without acting like the current repo is the whole world.

This file is intended to be copied or generated into every major repo as `llms.txt`.

## Read this first

- This ecosystem spans multiple repos. Do not assume the current repo contains the whole system.
- Everything starts with **Katailyst**. Use Katailyst first for capability discovery, ecosystem orientation, and cross-system routing.
- Use **Axon second** for repo comprehension, critical path analysis, impact analysis, and finding the real files and symbols that matter.
- If your task touches HLTMastery public routes, Next.js publishing, Framer pages, media generation, article workflows, or cross-system data flow, assume cross-repo inspection is required.
- Verify **live/runtime truth** before making architectural claims.
- Prefer a few official giant docs over stale note sprawl.
- Do not confuse shell ownership, public route ownership, content ownership, and media ownership. They are separate questions.

## Standard working method

1. Read this `llms.txt`
2. Read `AGENTS.md`
3. Read `cloud.md` if present
4. Use Katailyst MCP for orientation
5. Use Axon for repo comprehension
6. Check relevant sibling repos
7. Verify live URLs and runtime reality
8. Then edit, document, or operate

## Big-picture vision

This ecosystem exists to give AI agents a large, high-quality arsenal of building blocks, tools, knowledge, schemas, and integration surfaces that can be used in the right circumstance across many years, many models, and many platforms.

The goal is not one rigid workflow.
The goal is a smart adaptive system.

### Core strategic intent
- grow HLT over the next several months, especially in test prep and recruiting
- build an AI operating system that can continuously absorb new tools and capabilities as they appear
- make those capabilities usable across many platforms through Katailyst and related surfaces
- let agents operate with judgment, decomposition, critical thinking, and context rather than forcing every request into one pre-scripted playbook
- keep the system coherent, inspectable, repairable, and high quality even as it scales to thousands of entries and many people on the team

### What Katailyst should become for agents
Katailyst should act like a capability armory and orchestration layer.
Agents should bring their real objective and current situation, and the MCP/registry layer should help decompose that objective into smaller parts, search for the right capability regions, send sub-agents to inspect those regions, and bring back the best building blocks for composition.

That means the system should support workflows like:
1. agent brings objective and context
2. system decomposes the objective into 2-10 subproblems depending on complexity
3. vector/discovery search finds relevant regions, entities, tools, and knowledge blocks
4. sub-agents inspect those regions and traverse locally
5. sub-agents return the best components or observations
6. the main agent composes the result
7. the MCP and registry layer tracks what happened so the burden is not entirely on the agent to self-track

### Quality posture
- schemas should be strict and high quality
- agents should be encouraged to think critically, not mechanically
- agents may use 50%, 80%, or 100% of a capability if that is the right fit
- problems, drift, stale knowledge, and broken surfaces should be flagged rather than silently worked around
- hubs and front doors are useful, but the system should not rely only on shallow hub navigation. Deep search, region finding, and graph traversal matter.

### Business focus right now
- test prep growth
- recruiting growth
- marketing visibility and awareness
- scaling high-value educational resources and articles
- especially building broad topical coverage, including niche topics that are underserved but valuable

### Content ambition
A major near-term goal is an NCLEX encyclopedia or NCLEX OPedia style system with hundreds of articles across high-value topics, including the niche topics competitors miss. This should be informed by:
- search demand
- audience language and forum discussions
- product data
- question-bank and explanation data where appropriate
- what the best content operators in the world are doing right now

### Research posture
Agents should use tools like Firecrawl, Tavily, and forum or customer research to understand what the audience actually cares about, how they speak, and what topics deserve coverage. This should not rely only on the user manually providing topics.

### Benchmarking posture
Study strong operators and apply lessons to the system. Follow and analyze examples like:
- Replit
- Vercel
- New York Times
- other best-in-class resource and article creators

### System centerpieces
- **Katailyst** is the centerpiece of skills, capabilities, schema, and orchestration
- **Agent Canvas** is the centerpiece of agents, plans, and coordination surfaces
- **sidecars** are use-case launch surfaces, not hard limitations; they should still be able to call broad capability surfaces
- **Multimedia Mastery + Cloudinary** are central to the multimedia future
- **Evidence-Based Business** should increasingly hold important data and measurement layers

### Agentic infrastructure posture (Vercel 3-pillar model, 2026-04)

HLT's ecosystem fits the three-pillar model for agentic infrastructure that Vercel articulated on 2026-04-09. Naming our posture in their frame makes it easier to reason about what we have, what we're missing, and what we're buying / building next.

1. **Infra for coding agents to deploy to.** Vercel preview URLs on every commit + per-repo `llms.txt` + `AGENTS.md` discipline + fresh Axon graphs give Claude Code, Cursor, v0, and our internal agents the programmatic deployment surface they need to close the write-test-ship loop without a human opening a console. Every sidecar + MP + multimedia-mastery runs on Vercel; gpt-researcher runs on Railway; katailyst on Vercel with MCP at `/mcp`.
2. **Infra for building + running agents.** Vercel AI SDK underpins every specialist writer in sidecar (Opus 4.7 via `generateObject`). Katailyst MCP is our capability canon + vault-resolved `tool_execute` bridge. Langfuse handles tracing (per `kb:langfuse-tracing-hlt`). Cloudinary + Multimedia Mastery handle media. Paperclip handles governance. **Known gaps in this pillar:** (a) durable workflows / queues — specialists dispatch one-shot via `generateObject`; no pause/resume/retry semantics; Inngest (already in `~/hlt/mastra`) or Vercel Workflows would close this; (b) sandboxed execution — we have no isolated environment for agent-generated executable artifacts (dataviz React components, ad landing pages); Vercel Sandbox or E2B-equivalent needed before we let specialists execute code they wrote; (c) AI Gateway equivalent — Katailyst MCP is a capability catalog, not a model-routing + budget + retry + fallback layer; when we operate across Anthropic + OpenAI + Google + Groq, a gateway pattern gives us unified budgets + provider fallbacks.
3. **Infra that is itself agentic.** Katailyst registry (`discover` → `traverse` → `tool_execute`) + `lint_ruleset:registry-graph-governance` + the planned drift-verifier cron + `memory_query` / `memory_write` MCP tools. The platform senses, reasons, and acts on its own behalf — with approval gates, not autonomously yet. Each specialist owns the full loop for its lane (dashboard + alert + code + fix), matching the OpenAI Frontier team's pattern documented in Ryan Leopold's harness-engineering article (2026-04). Morgan = ads: authors dashboard definition files + subscribes to CPI/fatigue alerts + inspects Meta insights + proposes creative refreshes + writes the weekly operator brief. Same pattern applies to Victoria, Bruce, Sam, Nova.

### Six-layer operating frame (from OpenAI Symphony, 2026-04)

The OpenAI Frontier team's Symphony spec defines six layers — policy, configuration, coordination, execution, integration, observability — plus a reflection layer (zero). Use this as an audit lens when reviewing any HLT sidecar or playbook:

- **Policy**: constraints encoded as text the agent reads (KBs, lint rules, prompts). HLT has solid coverage.
- **Configuration**: environment, vault, site config. Vault-first is the HLT answer (`kb:katailyst-vault-access-pattern`).
- **Coordination**: multi-step orchestration, pause/resume/retry. **HLT thin** — see pillar 2 gap above.
- **Execution**: `generateObject` / `tool_execute` / `dispatchSpecialist`. Strong.
- **Integration**: Catalyst MCP bridge, per-tool call_specs. Strong.
- **Observability**: Langfuse tracing, evaluator reports, `history_query`. Solid but not ubiquitous across specialists.
- **Reflection (layer 0)**: agent introspection of its own sessions, team-wide trajectory distillation. **HLT nearly absent** — `memory_write` is available via MCP but not wired into a daily loop. See drift-verifier + distillation cron in the polish plan.

## Katailyst-first rule

Use Katailyst before guessing at capabilities or inventing workflows.

### Standard startup pattern
1. `registry_capabilities`
2. `registry_session`
3. `registry_agent_context`
4. `discover / get_entity / traverse`
5. `tool_describe`
6. `tool_execute`

### Why this matters
Katailyst is the capability canon for this ecosystem. It exposes tools, prompts, entities, and integration surfaces that agents should reuse instead of re-inventing locally.

### Axon-grounded repo facts
- `lib/mcp/handlers/registry-read/capabilities.ts` contains the registry capabilities handler
- `lib/mcp/tool-definitions-read.ts` registers discovery and read tools like `discover`
- `lib/mcp/tool-definitions-execution.ts` registers execution surfaces like `tool.search`, `tool.describe`, and `tool.execute`
- `lib/docs/llms-index.ts` already contains llms rendering logic, including MCP surface rendering functions
- `deploy/openclaw-katailyst-plugin/index.ts` includes plugin-side prompt nudges and registry defaults

### Confirmed capability lanes
- research and web
- Firecrawl search, scrape, map, crawl, extract, batch-scrape
- Firecrawl browser and agent escalation
- Cloudinary tools
- AgentMail send and receive
- publish.email
- deploy and dev surfaces
- analytics and integration surfaces

## Axon rule

Use Axon for repo comprehension after Katailyst orientation.

### Axon is for
- symbol-level understanding
- impact analysis
- critical pathways
- identifying important files and modules
- understanding what calls what

### Axon is not enough by itself for
- source-of-truth ownership
- strategic role decisions
- public and live route ownership
- runtime reality

## Live surfaces (deployed URLs across HLT, verified 2026-04-18)

- **https://www.katailyst.com** (200) — Katailyst site + streamable-http MCP at `/mcp`.
- **https://hltmastery.com** (200) — public HLT domain. Framer shell + reverse-proxied MasteryPublishing `/nursing/resources`.
- **https://hltmastery.com/nursing/resources** (200) — MasteryPublishing public article surface.
- **https://sidecar-system.vercel.app** (200) — sidecar-system Vercel production.
- **https://multimediamastery.vercel.app** (307) — redirects to subpath. Media API + studio at `/api/media/v1/*`.
- **https://gpt-researcher-production-2b53.up.railway.app** (405 on HEAD, POST-only endpoints live) — `POST /api/quick_search`, `POST /report/`.
- **https://answers.hltcorp.com** (200) — Evidence-Based Business / Metabase.
- **https://hltadspdash-gqtedncp.manus.space** — Manus-built Meta Ads dashboard (operator-shared; keep live alongside the sidecar `/admin/ads-command-center` when that ships).
- **https://ai4mastery-next-two.vercel.app** — AI4EDU publishing surface (`POST /api/publish` consumes ArticleV2).
- Per-app product sites: `nclexrnmastery.com`, `fnpmastery.com`, `teasmastery.com`, `nclexpnmastery.com`, `asvabmastery.com`, `inbdemastery.com`, and the broader per-exam set — see the HLT Master Almanac (linked below) for the full list with app-store + social handles.

## Agent fleet (identity lives in Katailyst registry)

- **Victoria** — articles persona. Load via `registry_agent_context(agent_ref: "agent:victoria")` or `content_type:agent-doc-map`. Stack: SOUL/AGENTS/USER/TOOLS/MEMORY agent-doc pattern.
- **Julius** — automation + workflow persona.
- **Lila** — marketing + content persona.
- **Ares** — security / governance persona.
- Plus 11 more agents in the fleet (see `content_type:agent-doc-map` for the full table).
- Chat-UI persona layer (Sam / Morgan / Bruce / Nova for social / ads / recruiting / dataviz) is a planned overlay on top of the existing agent-doc stack, NOT a replacement — the canonical identity stays in Katailyst `agent_doc:*`. Load existing docs via `registry_agent_context` at session start.

## Product canon (external — pointer only, NEVER inline here)

- **HLT Master Almanac v2** — per-app financials (YTD revenue, AFC%, conversion, user counts, tier flags T1/T2/T3), Meta Dev App IDs, per-product Facebook/Instagram/TikTok/YouTube handles + follower counts, app-store + Play Store links. Operator-owned doc; circulated in planning sessions. **Not yet committed to a canonical path in Obsidian.** Suggested home: `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/OpenClaw/System Maps/Core Maps/hlt-master-almanac-v2.md`. Until saved, ask the operator for the current copy. Product-level truth lives there; this file (system canon) points at it and does not duplicate.
- **Nurse Recruiting Corpus** — see `~/hlt/sidecar/docs/recruiting-corpus/` for compensation + demographics + happiness + personality research used by the recruiting specialist.
- **Ads Methodology** — see `~/hlt/sidecar/docs/ads-methodology/ad-copy-variants.md` for the operator's 7-day NCLEX rotation methodology (4 hook types × 4 audience segments).

## Official canon docs

These are the intended top-level canonical docs in Obsidian:
- `00-START-HERE`
- `01-ecosystem-atlas-master`
- `02-content-media-publishing-atlas`
- `03-repo-runtime-ledger`
- `04-integration-schema-reference`
- `05-llms-ecosystem-master`

Use these before digging through older overlapping notes.

## Current truths and decisions

These are the current truths agents should operate from unless a newer verified source overrides them:

- Katailyst is the centerpiece of skills, capabilities, schema, registry, and orchestration
- Agent Canvas is the centerpiece of agent and plan coordination thinking
- sidecar-system is an upstream workflow and publishing-orchestration surface, not just a local UI shell
- MasteryPublishing is the canonical structured `/resources/**` content destination
- Framer is a first-class shell, landing-page, navigation, branded public-experience, and legacy or public content surface
- Cloudflare proxy stitches public HLTMastery routes across multiple underlying systems
- Cloudinary is the intended system of record for media assets and derivatives
- Multimedia Mastery is the intended multimedia generation and media-workflow lane
- the Next.js publishing page and HLTMastery route alignment are among the most important near-term live surfaces
- sidecar should remain able to publish to both Framer and the structured content lane where that is strategically right
- agents should always use Katailyst first and Axon second when operating in this ecosystem
- the public domain is not the same thing as the canonical system boundary
- shell ownership, route ownership, content ownership, and media ownership are separate questions and should not be collapsed together casually

## Repo inventory

For each major repo, this document should answer:
- what the repo is
- what it is for
- how it fits the broader system
- what surfaces other agents interact with
- what URLs and routes matter
- what shapes or contracts matter operationally
- where to inspect first

> ⚠ Staleness audit 2026-04-17: this inventory covers **8 of 15** active repos the `sync-llms-to-repos.sh` script now fans into. Missing: **Engage**, **Nursing Jobs**, **Forum Template**, **Brand Design Lab**, **GPT Researcher**, **Mastra**, **Operator Evals**, **Paperclip**, **Research Team**. Local paths below still say `/Users/alecwhitters/Downloads/...` but the canonical path migrated to `/Users/alecwhitters/hlt/<repo>` on 2026-04-17; treat the Downloads paths as aliases. **Content Creator Studio** and **EduMastery** are in `~/Downloads/AI2 April/` and `~/Downloads/` respectively; neither is in the active `~/hlt/` working set or the sync-script target list.

## Current focus: Framer + Next.js + article sidecar flow

This is the current focus and should be easy for every agent to understand.

### The three-system flow
1. **sidecar-system** is the upstream article creation and publishing orchestration surface
2. **MasteryPublishing (Next.js)** is the canonical structured `/resources/**` destination
3. **Framer and HLTMastery shell** are the branded public shell, navigation layer, and legacy or public surface

### How they flow together
- sidecar creates or refines structured article content
- sidecar can publish to the structured content engine and to Framer when strategically appropriate
- MasteryPublishing renders the structured Next.js article lane
- Cloudflare proxy makes the Next.js lane appear inside the HLTMastery public route family
- Framer still owns the public shell, nav, footer, landing pages, and some legacy or public content families

### Short operating rule
If the task touches the current article pipeline, you almost always need to reason across these three together:
- sidecar-system
- MasteryPublishing
- Framer and HLTMastery public shell

## Cross-repo check matrix

| If the task touches... | Check these first |
|---|---|
| capability discovery, agent tooling, MCP, schemas, registry | Katailyst |
| article creation flow, publish orchestration, destination choice | sidecar-system + Katailyst |
| structured `/resources/**` pages, publish API, revalidation, article display | MasteryPublishing + sidecar-system |
| HLTMastery public shell, nav, footer, landing pages, legacy blog or resources | Framer and HLTMastery shell + MasteryPublishing |
| article images, media generation, branded assets, transformations | Multimedia Mastery + Cloudinary |
| recruiting and test-prep content strategy, topic discovery, performance learning | Katailyst + Evidence-Based Business + research lanes |
| agent coordination, plans, multi-agent work | Agent Canvas + Katailyst |
| corporate educational data, QBank explanation context, upstream content inventory | corporate CMS + relevant publishing and content repos |

## HLTMastery, Framer, and proxy boundary

### Verified public site
- `https://hltmastery.com`

### Verified route examples
- `https://hltmastery.com/nursing/resources`
- `https://hltmastery.com/nursing/nclex-blog`

### Architecture summary: two systems, one domain
The public domain is shared across multiple underlying systems.

- `hltmastery.com/nursing/resources/*` is the structured Next.js content lane served from MasteryPublishing through a reverse-proxy layer
- Framer still owns major shell and public-experience surfaces, including homepage, navigation, footer, and legacy or separate content surfaces
- Cloudflare proxying and path rewriting make these systems feel like one domain even when ownership is split underneath

### Boundary model
- **Katailyst** = canon and orchestration truth
- **sidecar-system** = workflow surface and destination chooser
- **MasteryPublishing** = canonical structured resource destination
- **Framer** = shell, landing pages, brand-facing page builder, navigation layer, and still-important public experience surface
- **Cloudflare proxy** = path stitcher, not canon
- **Multimedia Mastery + Cloudinary** = media lane feeding destinations

### Route mapping to keep in mind
| Public route family | Underlying owner | Meaning | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/nursing/resources` | MasteryPublishing via proxy | structured resources hub | live |
| `/nursing/resources/<product>` | MasteryPublishing via proxy | structured product landing | live |
| `/nursing/resources/<product>/<slug>` | MasteryPublishing via proxy | structured article detail | live |
| `/nursing/resources/search` | MasteryPublishing via proxy | structured search lane | live |
| `/nursing/nclex-blog/*` | Framer | legacy or public blog lane | keep for now |
| `/nursing/fnp/resources/*` | Framer | Framer-managed resource lane | separate lane |
| `/`, main nav, footer, shell surfaces | Framer | public shell and brand experience | shell owner |

### Next.js and MasteryPublishing route anatomy
- `app/resources/page.tsx::ResourcesPage` drives the resources hub via `getResourcesPageSettings` and `getProducts`
- `app/resources/[product]/page.tsx::ProductPage` drives per-product landing routes
- `app/resources/[product]/[slug]/page.tsx::ArticlePage` drives article detail routes via `getArticleBySlug`, `getArticlePageSettings`, and `getProductBySlug`
- `app/resources/search/page.tsx` handles search
- `app/sitemap.ts::sitemap` handles sitemap generation using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and article and product inventory

### Why the HLTMastery route matters so much
The Next.js publishing page and `/nursing/resources/*` route family are one of the most important near-term live surfaces. They need to stay synchronized with HLTMastery expectations around:
- menu and navigation clarity
- logos and branding
- shell integration expectations
- canonical URLs and metadata
- recruiting and future vertical extensibility
- rich HTML and multimedia support

### Current shell truth
Agents should assume the Content Engine does **not** currently own the whole shell.
That means nav, footer, visual chrome, and overall branded public-experience alignment with Framer are real system concerns, not cosmetic afterthoughts.

### Framer rule
Do not blindly copy Framer pages.
Use this model:
- keep **Framer** as an important shell, landing page, navigation, and branded public-experience layer
- keep **MasteryPublishing** as the canonical structured `/resources/**` lane
- keep sidecar able to publish to **both** when that is strategically right
- use projection, synchronization, and coexistence deliberately rather than collapsing the systems together without boundaries

- `meta_description`
- `word_count`
- `reading_time_minutes`
- `status`
- `featured`
- `topic_slugs`

### sidecar publish destinations
Known destination families include:
- `content_engine` to MasteryPublishing and the structured Next.js content lane
- Framer resource upsert to Framer CMS draft and live lane
- Framer publish request to explicit site publish and deploy lane
- `ai4edu` to adjacent publishing lane when enabled
- social, email, and other downstream destinations via orchestration surfaces

### Rendering path for the public site
```text
User requests hltmastery.com/nursing/resources/<product>/<slug>
-> Cloudflare worker intercepts /nursing/resources/*
-> proxies to MasteryPublishing /resources/<product>/<slug>
-> Next.js fetches article and settings from Supabase
-> Cloudflare rewrites internal links to keep /nursing/resources prefix
-> user sees structured content on hltmastery.com
```

### MasteryPublishing canonical publish contract
Required core fields include:
- `katailyst_id`
- `slug`
- `title`
- `product_slug`

Additional important fields include:
- `body_html`
- `body_json`
- `hero_image_url`
- `hero_image_alt`
- `hero_video_url`
- `og_image_url`
- `category`
- `audience_stage`
- `difficulty_level`
- `tags`
- `estimated_value`
- `faq_json`
- `stats_json`
- `steps_json`
- `comparison_json`
- `citations`
- `meta_title`
- `meta_description`
- `canonical_url`
- `noindex`
- `status`
- `published_at`
- `featured`
- `sort_order`
- `word_count`
- `reading_time_minutes`
- `author_slug`
- `topic_slugs`

### SEO and canonicalization rules
- canonical URLs for structured resources should use `https://hltmastery.com/nursing/resources/*`
- `og:url` should use the public HLTMastery domain, not the raw Vercel domain
- sitemap generation should reflect the intended public domain and route family
- article schema and metadata should point at the public canonical route
- coexistence with Framer legacy routes should be deliberate to avoid duplicate-content confusion

## Cloudinary system summary

### Account identity
- **Cloud name:** `HLT Media`
- **Product environment ID:** `c-1e2a3dbe7b0abcf38e49df4f50a4da`

### Useful console links
- Plans: `https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-1e2a3dbe7b0abcf38e49df4f50a4da/settings/billing/plans`
- Media library: `https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-1e2a3dbe7b0abcf38e49df4f50a4da/assets/media_library/folders/home?view_mode=list`
- Metadata fields: `https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-1e2a3dbe7b0abcf38e49df4f50a4da/assets/media_library/metadata_fields`
- Security settings: `https://console.cloudinary.com/app/c-1e2a3dbe7b0abcf38e49df4f50a4da/settings/security`

### What Cloudinary is for
Cloudinary should be treated as the intended system of record for media assets and derivatives across the ecosystem.

### Top-level folder structure
- `articles/`
- `branding/`
- `in-app/`
- `inbox/`
- `multimedia/`
- `products/`
- `samples/`
- `shared/`
- `social/`

### Metadata fields configured
- `status`
- `source`
- `app_id`
- `vertical`
- `asset_type`

### Watermark and branding model
Cloudinary supports overlay-based watermarking and named transformations.
Recommended HLT pattern:
- store logos in `branding/logos/`
- create named transformations such as `t_hlt_watermark`
- use platform-specific branded transformations for social and media derivatives

### Multimedia rule of thumb
- Multimedia Mastery should be the preferred media-generation and media-workflow lane
- Cloudinary should be the preferred storage, derivative, and branding system of record
- direct generation flows that bypass Cloudinary may be expedient, but they are structurally weaker and should not become the default long-term pattern
- article image quality, asset persistence, tagging, and branded delivery are part of the real system, not optional polish

## Corporate data and CMS reality

There is also a major corporate CMS and database outside the current Katailyst ecosystem that matters.

### Corporate CMS posture
- this system houses large amounts of critical company data, including practice-question and educational content inventory
- it is effectively a major upstream data system for corporate apps
- it should be treated cautiously
- current safe posture is primarily read-oriented, with only carefully limited write behavior where explicitly approved and reliable

### Example surface
- `https://cms.hltcorp.com/items/49311/edit`

### QBank and educational explanation relevance
This corporate data includes structures like:
- question stem
- answer choices
- submission flow
- choice-specific rationale
- key takeaway
- longer explanation and teaching content

These explanation surfaces matter because they can inform:
- educational content quality
- article creation
- SEO topic generation
- teaching patterns
- future content adaptation and enrichment

## Near-term priorities that matter right now

### Highest-priority live surface
The Next.js publishing page and HLTMastery route alignment are among the most important immediate execution priorities.

### What that means concretely
- get the Next.js publishing page live and synced properly with HLTMastery and Framer
- clarify services around the Next.js publishing page, menu and navigation needs, logos, and branding
- keep sidecar able to publish to both Framer and the Next.js content lane
- improve HTML handling and richer multimedia capabilities for the new service layer
- support recruiting and future vertical pages, not just one narrow surface
- improve Slack access for resident agents
- use Victoria, Julius, and Lila as real durable agents, not just ephemeral spin-up workers
- strengthen Agent Canvas as the coordination and canvas layer

### Immediate stabilization checklist
- audit current Supabase article inventory, including published, draft, and missing-image states
- fix visible image 404s and remove placeholder image dependencies
- add canonical tags for structured resources on the HLTMastery public domain
- update `og:url` and related metadata to use the public domain instead of raw Vercel URLs
- verify sitemap and robots behavior for `/nursing/resources/*`
- document the publish workflow clearly so agents know when to use which destination

### Media pipeline stabilization
- fix Multimedia Mastery schema or Oracle failures that block image generation
- connect sidecar article workflows to Multimedia Mastery where appropriate
- route article images through Cloudinary as the asset system of record
- use Cloudinary transformations for branding, watermarking, and distribution

### Content and growth priority
- grow test prep and recruiting visibility through broad high-quality resource and article coverage
- push toward an NCLEX OPedia or encyclopedia style content surface
- cover high-value niche topics at scale
- use forums, Firecrawl, Tavily, product data, and educational data to identify the best topics instead of relying only on manually proposed ideas

### Framer coexistence rule
- keep Framer for shell, public experience, and legacy lanes while the structured content lane proves itself
- do not rush migration just for elegance
- measure speed, SEO, workflow quality, and publishing velocity before large-scale sunset decisions

### Other-session mission specs (authored 2026-04-18 by a parallel Claude session)

These are grounded via Axon + Katailyst MCP. Spec-only — zero code changes yet. Each spec is a focused PR sequence with feature-flagged rollout. Total ~3,700 spec-lines across 4 docs in `~/hlt/katailyst/docs/planning/active/`:

- **`2026-04-18-mission-1-2-mcp-bridge-studio-wiring.md`** (786 lines). Mission 1 promotes sidecar's MCP-bridge pattern (`lib/mcp/bridge.ts`, `lib/integrations/catalyst-mcp.ts`, `lib/sidecar/prompt-builder.ts`) into a repo-local primitive that Sidecar, Creation Studio, and agent-canvas each import — three version-locked copies now, private npm publish later. Mission 2 wires the primitive into Creation Studio + adds a `run_registry_tool({ tool_ref, inputs })` tool exposing all 126 Katailyst tools. Studio today has 11 bespoke tools; after M2 it inherits every registered tool.
- **`2026-04-18-mission-3-5-persistence-replay.md`** (714 lines). Server-side Creation Studio persistence + live thought-stream SSE + replay at `/replay/[session_id]`. **Strategic pivot:** reuse existing `runs` / `run_steps` / `run_events` / `run_tool_calls` / `payload_store` infrastructure (236 runs, 418 steps, 1,460 events, RLS enforced) rather than invent a parallel schema. This supersedes the earlier "thought_stream SSE" proposal in polish-plan Phase 4b.
- **`2026-04-18-mission-4-sidecar-bml-loop.md`** (1,501 lines). Three sidecar BML-loop fixes, each feature-flagged: **M4.1** registry-backed `loadRubric()` (~180 LOC, 3.5 hrs) — today's stub only returns FNP; Katailyst has 20 published rubrics. **M4.2** `loadBrandVoiceContext(product_slug)` runtime pipe (~260 LOC, 5 hrs) — today's FNP writer voice is hand-distilled in a const string; brand-voice KB updates don't propagate without a code deploy. **M4.3** explicit `routeSpecialist()` (~110 LOC, 2 hrs) — today silently falls through to FNP for 16 of 18 product slugs.
- **`2026-04-18-mission-6-seam-bugs.md`** (703 lines). Three cross-repo seam bugs: **6a** MM `/api/media/v1/image/generate` unauthenticated (any CORS-allowed origin can burn Fal credits). **6b** Forum `/api/internal/threads` doesn't exist (sidecar's `publishToForum()` 404s end-to-end). **6c** Content-Engine URL default is misleading — canonical prod is `v0-next-js-content-engine.vercel.app`; `mastery-publishing.vercel.app/api/publish` is `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`.

Plus `docs/reports/morning-brief/2026-04-17/second-run-audit.md` flagging: 3 integration readiness FAILs (clean-ebb 33/100, openclaw 20/100, replit 60/100 WARN), fleet probe `/api/health` 404 on 4 major repos for 2 consecutive days, canonical scratch folders missing, morning-brief SKILL has no idempotency guard.

These missions are the next-session work plan. This file surfaces them so the next agent landing in any repo knows they're pending — not as a mandate to execute them now.

## Key rules that agents must follow

These rules are HLT's operating principles for agentic work. They are stated in our own voice; external frames (Vercel, OpenAI Frontier, the llms.txt spec) are credited at the end of the section as the places where we sharpened the thinking, not as the source of the rules themselves.

### Epigraph (HLT operator posture)

> Your primary job is not to "make changes." Your primary job is to understand what the system is trying to do, then make changes that strengthen that system without leaving a mess behind. In this environment, slow and accurate beats fast and sloppy.
>
> — HLT_01 Agent Operating Doctrine

### Operator-stated principles

These are the operator's own directives, stated in the operator's voice. They precede the foundational + operating-principle rules below because they set the posture for *why* those rules exist.

1. **Top-1% research bar.** Before bringing anything into HLT, research the top 1% of options in the same space. Find pre-validated concepts from best-in-class companies. More research, more planning, more reading, more looking around the ecosystem is almost always worth it. The operator is not a developer — the team must vet + flesh out research before committing code or customer-facing work.
2. **Customer discovery is pre-validated, not guessed.** Use Data for SEO, Katailyst's existing research KBs, and real audience signal. Don't ship resonance we haven't tested. Find the things our audience actually cares about, backed by data.
3. **Katailyst is the centerpiece.** Everything routes through it. MCP as the backbone. Agents decompose objectives via the registry + their own reasoning. New surfaces inherit observability, governance, brand voice, and tools from Katailyst by default.
4. **Rapid spin-up is a core capability.** We should be able to launch new templates, chatbots, apps, and per-domain front-ends fast, from existing pieces. Katailyst backend + MCP is the fast path. Each new template inherits the full stack by default.
5. **Partial + flexible over strict orchestration.** Give users and clients building blocks they can fill gaps in. Trust that agents are intelligent — don't over-mandate their paths. The difference between a "rails" platform and a "tools" platform: we want tools.
6. **Global llms.txt + Axon.** One update point, fans out everywhere. This is the discoverability + observability layer. Continue investing; don't let it drift.
7. **Observability everywhere.** All agents see all other things as much as humanly possible. Every specialist, every tool, every surface produces traces. This is the reflection layer (layer 0) of the 7-layer operating frame; currently the thinnest layer in HLT's stack.
8. **Agent Canvas is where agents live.** Not today — today's priority is finishing the long-form content sidecar connection + MasteryPublishing quality + recruiting forum integration. But the architecture direction is: agents live in Agent Canvas, move off Replit eventually.

### Foundational rules

- Do not assume the current repo is the whole system.
- Use Katailyst first.
- Use Axon second.
- Check sibling repos when the task crosses boundaries.
- Prefer official canon docs over scattered notes.
- Do not confuse shell and public route ownership with canonical content ownership.
- Do not perform dangerous publish actions without explicit approval where required.
- Document concrete things, not vague summaries.

### Operating principles for agentic work

- **Canon compounds or evaporates — choose.** Every non-obvious failure an agent or human hits produces two artifacts: the fix, and the invariant encoded as durable text the next session will read. The invariant lives wherever its scope matches — KB, prompt, lint rule, rubric, system-maps entry, repo-local AGENTS.md. Without the second artifact, the team pays the same cost twice. With it, knowledge compounds. This is the single highest-leverage discipline we practice. See `kb:friction-to-canon`.

- **A persona is a domain, not a task.** Each specialist owns the full loop for its lane — drafting, dashboards, alerts, logs, and follow-up fixes. Morgan doesn't just write ad copy; Morgan subscribes to the CPI alert, reads the Meta insights, proposes the creative refresh, and writes the weekly brief. Fragmenting a domain across multiple agents costs more context than it saves. When a new surface enters a persona's domain, it joins that persona — it does not spawn a new one.

- **Minimum necessary context.** Every token in the agent's window is a trade. Pay for the ones that earn their keep; drop the ones that don't. Default to narrow tool surfaces and expand on demand (e.g., Katailyst's `X-Katailyst-Toolset: bootstrap` for first-glance, widen only when the task demands it). Durable text in canon usually beats always-on tool catalogs for narrow needs. When in doubt, a tiny CLI shim the agent shells out to is cheaper in the context window than a forcibly-injected tool set.

- **Identify your actual inner loop and garden it.** For HLT, the inner loop for agentic work is usually **specialist dispatch → evaluator → approval gate**, not build/test. A specialist generating an article on Opus 4.7 is a 15-60s round-trip; a build takes 6s; the build is not the binding constraint. The principle ("measure what the agent actually waits for between iterations, garden it when it regresses") matters; the specific threshold depends on which loop you're measuring. Build time is a secondary hygiene metric — keep it reasonable (HLT soft budgets: audit at 90s, escalate at 180s, emergency at 270s) but don't optimize it at the expense of the real loop. When adding a new specialist or integration, name which inner loop it's in, measure the round-trip once, and log the baseline somewhere (e.g., `~/hlt/sidecar/docs/build-time.md` for sidecar).

- **Drafts, not auto-publishes.** Every specialist's output is a draft until a human signs off. The approval gate is a feature, not a bottleneck — it protects trust with our audience and keeps the team out of customer-facing mistakes. Postmerge review on internal tooling is fine; premerge approval on customer-facing content is non-negotiable.

- **HLT operates in three concentric infrastructure layers.** (1) The layer agents deploy into (Vercel preview URLs + our per-repo canon + Axon). (2) The layer agents run on (Vercel AI SDK + Catalyst MCP + Langfuse + Multimedia Mastery + Cloudinary + Paperclip). (3) The layer that itself acts on HLT's behalf (Katailyst registry + lint_rulesets + drift-verifier + specialist personas with full-loop ownership). Every new surface, vendor, or integration should be evaluated against which layer it strengthens. Gaps we've named (see `## Known gaps` below) live in layers 2 and 3.

- **Seven-layer audit lens.** When something breaks, locate the weakest layer — don't patch symptoms. The stack: reflection (layer 0) → policy → configuration → coordination → execution → integration → observability. Execution + integration + observability are where HLT is strongest. Coordination (durable workflows, pause/resume/retry) and reflection (agent introspection, team trajectory distillation) are where we're thinnest. When reviewing a specialist or a sidecar, ask which layer is the binding constraint.

### Where these principles come from

- **Vercel, "Agentic Infrastructure"** (Tom Occhino, 2026-04-09) — sharpened the 3-pillar framing above. The principle (design for agent primacy, not human-command-line primacy) is ours; the 3-pillar language is borrowed.
- **OpenAI Frontier "harness engineering"** (Ryan Leopold, 2026-04) — sharpened the friction-to-canon discipline, the persona-owns-its-full-loop rule, the MCP-autocompaction caveat, and the build-time-as-forcing-function discipline.
- **OpenAI Frontier "Symphony"** (2026-04) — sharpened the seven-layer audit lens.
- **llms.txt spec** (llmstxt.org) — not applied verbatim; HLT's multi-repo fan-out pattern is deliberately different (see `kb:llms-txt-hlt-pattern`).

These frames get updated as the field moves. The principles above do not change with every new framework. If a principle no longer matches HLT's reality, that's the signal to update it — not to relearn it.

## Known gaps (named, not hidden)

- **Durable agent workflows / queues.** Specialists dispatch one-shot via `generateObject`; no pause/resume/retry/background semantics. `~/hlt/mastra` has Inngest; Vercel Workflows is another option. Agentic coordination layer is the thinnest layer in our 6-layer frame.
- **Sandboxed execution.** No isolated environment for agent-generated executable artifacts. Safe today because output is media/text/JSON — but blocks future specialists that emit React components or landing pages. Solution: Vercel Sandbox or E2B-equivalent.
- **AI Gateway equivalent.** Katailyst MCP is a catalog, not a model-routing + budget + retry + provider-fallback layer. Multi-provider operation (Anthropic + OpenAI + Google + Groq across `~/hlt/sidecar`) would benefit.
- **Reflection layer (trajectory distillation).** `memory_write` is available via MCP; no daily loop slurps session trajectories, distills patterns, or proposes KB/rule updates yet. Planned as part of the drift-verifier cron.
- **Internal-tooling postmerge review discipline.** Specialists use premerge approval gates (right for customer-facing content). Internal tooling could shift to postmerge review to speed agent iteration — not yet adopted.
- **Build time audits across the 15 repos.** Not measured systematically; a one-off audit is pending.
- **Obsidian System Maps / `Core Maps/` drift.** 20+ supporting maps not re-verified since 2026-04; operator flagged some as stale. Keep/merge/archive audit pending.
- **Integration readiness FAILs (from `registry_health` 2026-04-17).** `clean-ebb` score 33/100 FAIL — missing `clean-ebb/api-token` secret + `POST /api/ai-analysis` endpoint. `openclaw` score 20/100 CRITICAL FAIL — missing `openclaw/gateway-token`, `openclaw/victoria/gateway-token` secrets + `GET /health` + `POST /v1/chat/completions`. `replit` score 60/100 WARN — no active account / secret. Fleet probe `/api/health` still 404 on Katailyst, sidecar, MasteryPublishing, Multimedia Mastery for 2+ consecutive days. Source: `~/hlt/katailyst/docs/reports/morning-brief/2026-04-17/second-run-audit.md`.
- **Content-engine URL default is misleading.** Canonical prod is `v0-next-js-content-engine.vercel.app` (401 on bad key = live). `mastery-publishing.vercel.app/api/publish` is `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND`. Sidecar + Katailyst silently fall back to the wrong URL when `CONTENT_ENGINE_API_URL` is unset. Mission 6c fix: fail loud in production.
- **Marketo middleware gap.** `tool:marketo` registered in Katailyst, but the n8n / Make.com webhook middleware that bridges Katailyst content_json → Marketo HTML → delivery is not yet built. Marketo instance: `758-CUU-617` (838K contacts, 7 exam verticals). The zero-manual-email-builds doctrine from the Marketo machine spec is the north star.
- **Multimedia image/generate is unauthenticated.** Any CORS-allowed origin can burn Fal credits. Four external callers on record (sidecar ×2, mastery-publishing, katailyst). Mission 6a fix.
- **Forum `/api/internal/threads` doesn't exist.** Sidecar's `publishToForum()` 404s silently. Mission 6b fix.
- **Canonical Almanac path.** The HLT Master Almanac v2 (operator-owned product + financial canon) is circulated in planning sessions but has no committed path in Obsidian. Needs a real home at `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/OpenClaw/System Maps/Core Maps/hlt-master-almanac-v2.md` or equivalent.
- **Repo naming drift (local vs remote vs package.json).** Documented below under `## Naming consistency drift`. Four package.json scaffold residues known (`my-project`, `rest-express` ×2, `agent-sdk`). Two GitHub remotes off-pattern (`Agent-Canvas-` trailing dash; `whastra` vs `mastra`). Fix scheduled for a follow-up session with lockfile regen + deploy-manifest check.

## App portfolio (pointer only — product canon lives in Katailyst)

HLT's product portfolio is documented per-app as curated KBs in the Katailyst registry. This is the pointer so agents landing in any repo can find the right product canon without hunting. Every entry below exists; pull it via `get_entity(type: "kb", code: ...)`.

**Per-app brand profiles + platform setup KBs (registry canon, 2026-04-18):**

| App | Brand Profile | Platform Setup | Product Overview | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NCLEX RN Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-nclex-rn` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-nclex-rn` | `kb:hlt-product-overview-nclex-rn` | T1 flagship |
| NCLEX PN Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-nclex-pn` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-nclex-pn` | — | T2 |
| FNP Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-fnp` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-fnp` | `kb:hlt-product-overview-fnp` | T1 (highest revenue) |
| AGNP Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-agnp` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-agnp` | — | T2 |
| AG-ACNP Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-agacnp` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-agacnp` | — | T2 (store URLs pending) |
| PMHNP Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-pmhnp` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-pmhnp` | — | T2 |
| PANCE PANRE Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-pance` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-pance` | — | T2 |
| ATI TEAS Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-teas` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-teas` | — | T2 |
| ASVAB Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-asvab` | — | `kb:hlt-product-overview-asvab` | T2 |
| DAT Mastery | `kb:hlt-brand-profile-dat` | `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-dat` | — | T3 |

**Cross-portfolio KBs:**

- `kb:app-specific-notes` — per-app portfolio notes (feature flags, naming conventions, platform quirks, offer differences).
- `kb:product-positioning` **tier 2** — portfolio positioning backbone (value props, differentiators, market framing).
- `kb:pricing-and-offers` — subscription structure, price points, discount rules.
- `kb:hlt-product-config-app-upgrade-screen` — the paywall/upgrade screen config (A/B conversion surface).
- `kb:hlt-social-media-master` — audit of all HLT social accounts across 29 product verticals × 10 platforms (FB, IG, TikTok, YouTube, Threads, X, Reddit, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook Groups).
- `kb:hlt-brand-image-style-guide` — visual standards for AI-generated + photographed + designed assets.
- `kb:cloudinary-folder-architecture` **tier 2** — definitive folder structure under the single root `hlt/` on Cloudinary cloud `dq9xmts6p`. Consult before uploading, moving, or cleaning any asset.

**Known gaps in brand-profile coverage (apps that may or may not be live — operator to confirm):**

- HESI Mastery, CNA Mastery, EMT Mastery, PTCB Mastery, MCAT Mastery, ACLS Mastery, ECG Mastery, INBDE Mastery, NBDHE Mastery, CST Mastery — no `kb:hlt-brand-profile-<slug>` in registry as of 2026-04-18. Either these are not live apps, or the brand profile has not been authored yet. Authoring pass scheduled for a follow-up session once operator confirms the live roster.

**App Store + Play Store URLs and Meta Dev App IDs** live in the per-app `kb:hlt-product-setup-platform-*` KBs, not here. This file does not duplicate.

## Naming consistency drift (local dir ↔ GitHub remote ↔ package.json)

Audit 2026-04-18. Not breaking anything, but worth fixing in a follow-up so cross-repo tooling (remotes, deploy manifests, logs) stays legible.

| Local dir (~/hlt/\*) | GitHub remote | package.json `name` | Drift |
|---|---|---|---|
| `katailyst` | `katailyst` | `dashboard-app` | pkg name is scaffold residue |
| `sidecar` | `sidecar-system` | — (no package.json at root) | remote mismatch tolerable |
| `mastery-publishing` | `MasteryPublishing` | `my-project` | pkg name is v0/Next scaffold residue |
| `multimedia-mastery` | `Multimedia4Mastery` | `@mm/studio` | scoped pkg intentional; remote diverges |
| `engage` | `katailyst-engage` | `katailyst-engage` | consistent |
| `jobs` | `v1-Nursing-Jobs` | `rest-express` | pkg name is scaffold residue |
| `forum-template` | `forum-template` | `rest-express` | pkg name is scaffold residue |
| `agent-canvas` | `Agent-Canvas-` | `agent-sdk` | remote has trailing dash; pkg is scaffold residue |
| `brand-design-lab` | `katailyst-brand-design-lab` | `@katailyst/sidecar-template` | scoped pkg intentional; remote diverges |
| `evidence-based-business` | `cleanEBB` | `hlt-data-analyzer` | three different names |
| `gpt-researcher` | `hlt-gpt-researcher` | — (Python app) | consistent |
| `mastra` | `whastra` | — | remote typo? "whastra" vs "mastra" |
| `operator-evals` | `katailyst-operator-evals` | `katailyst-operator-evals` | consistent |
| `paperclip` | `paperclip` | `paperclip` | consistent |
| `research-team` | `alecs-research-council` | `agent-stack-mastra` | three different names |

**Fix playbook (follow-up session, not tonight):** rename the 4 obvious scaffold residues (`my-project` → `mastery-publishing`, `rest-express` × 2 → `hlt-jobs` / `hlt-forum-template`, `agent-sdk` → `agent-canvas`). Regenerate lockfiles + verify deploy manifests (Vercel, Render) pick up the new name. Leave scoped packages (`@mm/studio`, `@katailyst/sidecar-template`) alone — the scoping is intentional. Rename GitHub remotes only if the operator decides to, and only after a read of any external doc that hardcodes the old URL.

## Deep integration checklist (per-repo surface state, 2026-04-18)

This is the "are we really integrated" pass. Each repo should know: what it connects to, what keys it needs, what it publishes, who consumes it. Gaps here are integration failures, not code bugs.

| Repo | Catalyst MCP client | Vault secrets used | Publishes to | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `katailyst` | — (IS the MCP server) | 128 secrets in pgvault | Registry MCP | every other repo |
| `sidecar` | `CATALYST_MCP_URL` + `CATALYST_MCP_TOKEN` ✓ | via tool_execute (never direct) | MP + AI4EDU + Framer + Forum + Multimedia | operator + chat users |
| `mastery-publishing` | via Content-Engine publish API | `KATAILYST_API_KEY` | Framer proxy `/resources/*` on hltmastery.com | public via Framer |
| `multimedia-mastery` | direct Supabase + Cloudinary + Fal | Cloudinary + Fal + Supabase keys | Media API `/api/runner/publish` | sidecar + MP + katailyst |
| `engage` | MCP streamable-http + PAT | student Supabase (separate from katailyst) | in-app Practice + Studio | nurse students |
| `jobs` | — (data aggregator) | Drizzle/Neon DB creds | its own admin UI | — (inbound aggregator) |
| `forum-template` | not yet (Mission 6b fix pending) | `FORUM_INTERNAL_PUSH_SECRET` (planned) | its own threads/comments | nurse candidates / students |
| `agent-canvas` | PAT to katailyst | katailyst PAT | agent runtime canvas | fleet agents (Victoria, Julius, Lila, Ares, Magnus) |

**Critical seams to fix (cross-references `## Known gaps` above):**

1. **6a — MM unauthenticated image/generate.** Add bearer auth to `/api/media/v1/image/generate`; update all 4 external callers (sidecar ×2, MP, katailyst).
2. **6b — Forum missing internal endpoint.** Build `POST /api/internal/threads` on forum-template; sidecar's `publishToForum()` currently 404s.
3. **6c — Content-engine URL default.** Sidecar + katailyst silently fall back to the wrong URL when `CONTENT_ENGINE_API_URL` is unset. Fix: fail loud in production when missing.
4. **clean-ebb FAIL.** Missing `clean-ebb/api-token` secret + missing `POST /api/ai-analysis` endpoint. Integration score 33/100.
5. **openclaw CRITICAL FAIL.** Missing `openclaw/gateway-token` + `openclaw/victoria/gateway-token` secrets, plus missing `GET /health` + `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Integration score 20/100.
6. **Fleet `/api/health` 404.** 2 consecutive days of red probes on Katailyst, sidecar, MasteryPublishing, Multimedia Mastery. Cheap to add, blocks remote health dashboards.

## New social + ads platforms (planned scaffolds, not built yet)

Operator directive: isolate each platform into its own repo so credentials, rate limits, and error surfaces don't cross-contaminate. Manus-built dashboards stay live as reference while native sidecars catch up.

**Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram)** — current state: Manus dashboard live at `https://hltadspdash-gqtedncp.manus.space`. Native surface: sidecar `/admin/ads-command-center` (Phase 5 in polish plan), additive not replacement. Reads via `tool:meta-ads.insights` (Catalyst MCP) once `http_multi_action` executor ships.

**Google Ads** — no repo yet. Should be a separate sidecar `~/hlt/google-ads/` or a lane inside sidecar-system. Credentials in vault path `google-ads/*` (to be created). Isolated from Meta Ads per operator.

**Manus agent runs (non-Ads)** — `tool:manus.agent` already in registry. Separate credential path `manus/api-key`. Runs live in katailyst's run/step/event infrastructure.

**Social publishing fan-out** — `skill:social-content` specialist exists in sidecar. `tool:publish.social` is the abstract publisher; per-platform adapters (LinkedIn, TikTok, IG, X, Reddit, Threads, Pinterest, YouTube, Facebook Groups) live as channel KBs + playbooks in Katailyst. New social pages on any platform go here, not into a new repo each time.

**Ads + social isolation principle** — the sidecar hosts the creative + drafting + approval gate. The platform-specific publishing credentials live in vault, accessed via Catalyst MCP tool_execute (`tool:meta-ads.*`, `tool:google-ads.*` when built). No repo has both Meta and Google credentials in process memory at the same time.

**Recruiting forum integration** — the nurse-recruiting destination decided: MP route `/resources/nurse-recruiting/*` with Framer recruiting collection as Phase-3 follow-up. Recruiting specialist drafts push via Content Engine with `surface: "nurse-recruiting"` tag.

## Follow-up long to-do list (operator's directive: no debris; highly operable for agents)

Ordered by unblocked effort. Each item has a clear exit criterion.

### Phase A — Seam fixes (cross-repo correctness; unblocks downstream work)

1. **M6a — MM image/generate auth.** Add bearer token gate to `/api/media/v1/image/generate`; update 4 callers. ~6 hrs + coordinated deploy window. Spec: `~/hlt/katailyst/docs/planning/active/2026-04-18-mission-6-seam-bugs.md`.
2. **M6b — Forum `/api/internal/threads`.** Build the endpoint; sidecar `publishToForum()` then works end-to-end. ~2-3 hrs.
3. **M6c — Content-engine URL fail-loud.** Sidecar + katailyst throw at startup if `CONTENT_ENGINE_API_URL` unset in prod. ~1 hr.
4. **Fleet health probes.** Add `/api/health` 200-OK endpoint to katailyst, sidecar, MP, multimedia. ~30 min per repo × 4.
5. **clean-ebb integration.** Create `clean-ebb/api-token` vault secret + `POST /api/ai-analysis` endpoint. Integration score 33 → 80+.
6. **openclaw integration.** Create `openclaw/gateway-token` + `openclaw/victoria/gateway-token` secrets + `GET /health` + `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Score 20 → 80+.

### Phase B — Sidecar BML-loop fixes (Mission 4, feature-flagged)

7. **M4.1 — Registry-backed rubric loader.** Replace `loadRubric(id)` stub with `get_entity` call. Unlocks 20 published rubrics. ~3.5 hrs.
8. **M4.2 — Brand-voice runtime pipe.** `loadBrandVoiceContext(product_slug)` loads parent + product voice KBs; templated into specialist prompts via `{{BRAND_VOICE_OVERLAY}}`. ~5 hrs.
9. **M4.3 — Explicit specialist routing.** Replace silent FNP fall-through with `{ specialist_code, supported, reason }`. ~2 hrs.

### Phase C — Creation Studio + persistence (Missions 1-3-5)

10. **M1 — @hlt/agent-runtime extraction.** Three version-locked copies (sidecar, studio, agent-canvas) of the MCP-bridge pattern. Private npm publish later.
11. **M2 — run_registry_tool in Studio.** Studio inherits all 126 Katailyst tools. Today: 11 bespoke tools.
12. **M3 + M5 — Server-side persistence + SSE replay.** Reuse existing runs/run_steps/run_events infra; add `creation_sessions` header table + `/api/create/session/stream/[session_id]` + `/replay/[session_id]`. Supersedes earlier thought-stream proposal.

### Phase D — Sidecar specialist fill-in

13. **Social specialist (Tier 1b).** `domains/social/draft/{dispatch,batch-runner,specialists/social-writer}.ts`. Grounded in `kb:social-hook-patterns` + `kb:social-media-strategy-2026`. ~90 min.
14. **Ads specialist (Tier 2a).** `lib/schemas/ad-copy.ts` with `AdCampaignV1` (hook type + segment + emotional lever + week position + platform adapters). Grounded in `ad-copy-variants.md` + NCLEX ad methodology deck. Draft `rubric:ad-quality-v0` for operator approval. ~3-4 hrs.
15. **Recruiting specialist (Tier 2b, destination-deferred).** `lib/schemas/recruiting.ts` (outreach-email | landing-page | interview-guide | job-description | comp-package-one-pager). Grounded in `kb:viral-hooks-recruiting` + nurse-compensation corpus. Output lands in `sidecar_drafts` only until recruiting MP route ships. ~90 min.
16. **Dataviz specialist (polish plan Phase 4).** Pilot = NP state comp with COL adjustment (Hawaii paradox, Georgia anomaly, NM opportunity). Schema `DataVizSpec`; Recharts renderers. Output as new article `data_viz` block type + standalone `/resources/data/<slug>`.

### Phase E — Registry authoring (Tier 3, Katailyst-only session)

17. Author missing brand profiles if operator confirms apps are live: HESI, CNA, EMT, PTCB, MCAT, ACLS, ECG, INBDE, NBDHE, CST.
18. Author `hub:hub-ads` + `rubric:ad-quality` (after M14 draft approved) + `content_type:ad-copy-variation` + `ad-thumbnail-brief` + `paid-landing-page`.
19. Author `hub:hub-recruiting` + `rubric:recruiting-quality` + `content_type:nurse-recruiting-outreach-email` + 2 more.
20. Author `schema:ad_meta_v1` + `schema:ad_google_v1` + `schema:ad_tiktok_v1` as registry canon (sidecar then mirrors).
21. Author `kb:nurse-compensation-2025` + `kb:nurse-recruiting-market-analysis-2025` + `kb:nurse-personality-by-specialty` from `~/Downloads/recruitment/*` corpus.
22. Author `kb:nclex-ad-methodology` from `~/hlt/sidecar/docs/ads-methodology/` (ingest PDF + PPTX + MD).
23. Author `kb:hlt-content-engine-architecture` capturing Option B (Framer shell + Next.js /resources/* rewrite) + the v0-next-js-content-engine.vercel.app canonical URL.
24. Author `kb:hlt-marketo-operating-blueprint` (instance 758-CUU-617, lead-scoring formula, zero-manual-email-builds doctrine).

### Phase F — Naming + cleanup

25. Rename 4 scaffold-residue package.json names; regen lockfiles; verify deploy manifests.
26. Audit `Obsidian Vault/OpenClaw/System Maps/Core Maps/` for keep/merge/archive.
27. Commit the Almanac v2 to a canonical path once operator shares current copy.
28. Move any remaining `~/Downloads/AI2 April/*` assets that belong in HLT ecosystem to `~/hlt/` or to a dedicated `~/hlt/corpus/` read-only reference dir.

### Phase G — Automation + observability

29. **Drift-verifier cron `com.hlt.llms-verify` at 06:30 daily.** Per-repo: verify `git rev-parse HEAD` matches Recent changes in llms.txt; `axon status` fresh <24h; `REPO_LIVE_URL` resolves; `.env.example` VAR NAMES match master; key registry entities still exist. Output: `~/hlt/katailyst/docs/reports/drift/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Zero drift → auto-bumps `## Last verified` + commits. Any drift → stops + surfaces report. No silent auto-fix.
30. **Integration readiness cron.** Daily `registry_health` call; anything <70/100 produces a red-flag report to `docs/reports/integration-readiness/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
31. **Fleet probe cron.** Daily ping of each repo's `/api/health`; anything non-200 for 2+ consecutive days creates a Linear issue (or equivalent).
32. **Langfuse trace coverage cron.** Each specialist dispatch should emit a trace. Missing traces ≥5% over a 24h window = red flag.

### Operator-gated (do not execute until operator confirms)

- A1. Google Ads repo creation + vault path + first campaign scaffold.
- A2. Paperclip deployment (currently not deployed; mastra-gateway adapter WIP unblocks on this).
- A3. Move Agent Canvas off Replit onto dedicated infra.
- A4. Almanac v2 canonical path + any live-data wiring between Almanac and the system master.

## Companion files

### `AGENTS.md`
Should say:
- read `llms.txt` first
- follow repo-local rules after ecosystem orientation

### `cloud.md`
Should say:
- read `llms.txt` first
- this repo participates in a larger ecosystem
- runtime and deployment notes are local overlays, not the whole system map

## Sync and update model

This file should be maintained once and propagated everywhere.

### Current canonical source
- `/Users/alecwhitters/Documents/Obsidian Vault/OpenClaw/System Maps/05-llms-ecosystem-master.md`

### Current sync script
- `/Users/alecwhitters/.openclaw/workspace/system/sync-llms-to-repos.sh`

### Current generated outputs
Each target repo receives:
- `llms.txt`
- `llm.txt`
- `.well-known/llms.txt`

### Recommended implementation pattern
1. keep the master ecosystem source in Obsidian
2. keep small metadata files per repo only if truly needed later
3. generate repo copies automatically rather than hand-editing them
4. have `AGENTS.md` and `cloud.md` point agents to `llms.txt` first
5. later, validate generation in CI so stale copies are caught

### Why generation matters
If this is hand-maintained separately in each repo, it will drift and stop being trusted. The whole point is to have one document to keep excellent and then spread reliably.

## Last verified
- master ecosystem llms draft last updated: 2026-04-18 (added app portfolio pointer, naming drift table, deep integration checklist, new social/ads platforms, follow-up long to-do, drift-verifier cron plan)
- many repo and runtime details remain partially verified and should keep improving via the `com.hlt.llms-verify` drift cron once shipped

## Bottom line

This ecosystem is multi-repo, multi-runtime, multi-surface, and agents must not behave as if each repo is an island. This file exists to stop that failure mode and provide one official cross-repo entrypoint that can be copied into every important repo.
