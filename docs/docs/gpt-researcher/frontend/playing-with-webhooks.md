# Playing with Webhooks

The GPTR Frontend is powered by Webhooks streaming back from the Backend. This allows for real-time updates on the status of your research tasks, as well as the ability to interact with the Backend directly from the Frontend.


## Inspecting Webhooks

When running reports via the frontend, you can inspect the websocket messages in the Network Tab.

Here's how:

### Am I polling the right URL?

If you're concerned that your frontend isn't hitting the right API Endpoint, you can check the URL in the Network Tab.

Click into the WS request & go to the "Headers" tab
