# Roadmap

We're constantly working on additional features and improvements to our products and services. We're also working on new products and services to help you build better AI applications using [GPT Researcher](https://gptr.dev).

Our vision is to build the #1 autonomous research agent for AI developers and researchers, and we're excited to have you join us on this journey!

The roadmap is prioritized based on the following goals: Performance, Quality, Modularity and Conversational flexibility. The roadmap is public and can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/3O7KBePw/gpt-researcher-roadmap).
