Your task is to organize this research data into 3-5 logical sections with appropriate headers.
Each section should be comprehensive and detailed, with a minimum of 400 words per section.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include relevant sources in the content as markdown hyperlinks.
For example: 'This is a sample text. ([Source Title](url))'

For each major claim or piece of information, include a citation to the relevant source.
If a source doesn't have a URL, cite it by title.

Make sure each section covers a distinct aspect of the research topic and provides in-depth analysis.
The sections should flow logically and cover the topic comprehensively.

You MUST return nothing but a JSON array of section objects, each with a 'title' and 'content' field.
For example:
[
  {{
    "title": "Section Title 1",
    "content": "Detailed section content with sources..."

  {{
    "title": "Section Title 2",
    "content": "More detailed section content with sources..."
